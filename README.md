# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications

## Project Description
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector using various machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. The dataset contains customer usage data, service plans, and other relevant features.

## Key Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`train.csv`).
2. Preprocess data (encoding categorical variables, scaling).
3. Train multiple classifiers.
4. Evaluate performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.

## How to Run
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the analysis.
